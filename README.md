# Backgammon
This is a Backgammon game
Run main together with the other python files.

The player with the white pieces starts. The left mouse button is responsible for all operations. First click roll the dice. Then you have to click on the desired triangle and 2 or fewer options will appear according to the roll of the dice. Click on the desired option and the piece will move there. If you want to choose another triangle, just click on the desired triangle.
After moving the pieces the turn goes to the other player and so it continues.

Good luck!
